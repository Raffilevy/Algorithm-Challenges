# Algorithm-Challenges
A variety of different algorithm challenges and their solutions.

1) findOddInt - this method accpets an array of numbers and returns the only one that is shown an odd ammount of times.

2) spinWords - this method takes in an array of strings, and any word that is five letters or more, it reverses it, It returns a string with the proper spaces.

3) centuryFromYear - given an int year, returns what century that year was in.

4) checkPalindrome - given a String, returns whether or not it is a palindrome.

5) adjacentElementsProduct - given an array of integers, finds the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and returns that product.

6) shapeArea - given an "interesting polygon", returns the area of it. (A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side.) 

7) makeArrayConsecutive2 - given an array of unique integers, returns the minimum amount of unique integers needed so that the array can be rearranged in ascending order and increasing by one.

8) almostIncreasingSequence - given an array of integers, returns whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

9) matrixElementsSum - Given a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, returns the total sum of all valid rooms (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0).

10) allLongestStrings - Given an array of strings, returns another array containing all of the longest strings in the given array.
